## [](#header-2)#4 Careful not to jump to conclusions

I'm not a fan of sayings, but I always try and keep this one in mind.

> You judge others by their actions, but you judge yourself by your intentions

## [](#header-2)#3 I know I shouldn't, but...

How I judge people when meeting them in a business environment...

"If it came to it, would they push me off a cliff for personal gain?"

Avoid them if if the answer is "Yes". It's surprisingly accurate.

## [](#header-2)#3 Selfies

If more than half of your Instagram posts are selfies, I will make certain assumptions about you.

They won't be good.

## [](#header-2)#2 The Count of Monte Cristo - Alexandre Dumas

> Hope and wait

I just finished reading 'The Count of Monte Cristo' by Alexandre Dumas. Started reading it in Japan, and took about 6 weeks. It was the second attempt at reading it, glad I stuck with it this time round. 

Thoughts on the books on completion...
1.   This was the longest book I had read since 'A Suitable Boy' in 2005
1.   I need to read more fiction
1.   Is vengeance sometimes justified?
1.   What would I do if I was in that position? Even if I wanted to, would I be bothered?

Next read: Three Men in a Boat - Jerome K Jerome
