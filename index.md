# [](#header-1)Because I want to write

## [](#header-2)#2 The Count of Monte Cristo - Alexandre Dumas

> Hope and wait

I just finished reading 'The Count of Monte Cristo' by Alexandre Dumas. Started reading it in Japan, and took about 6 weeks. It was the second attempt at reading it, glad I stuck with it this time round. 

Thoughts on the books on completion...
1.  This was the longest book I had read since 'A Suitable Boy' in 2005
1.  I need to read more fiction
1.  Is vengeance sometimes justified?
1.  What would I do if I was in that position? Even if I wanted to, would I be bothered?

Next read: Three Men in a Boat - Jerome K Jerome

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
