        <p><b>#2 The Count of Monte Cristo</b>
          <p>
          I just finished reading 'The Count of Monte Cristo' a couple of days ago. It took a while (~6 weeks) and I realised that I hadn't read a book of this length since the summer of 2005, when I read 'A Suitable Boy'. It sounds ridiculous, but I felt a sense of accomplishment finishing it, probably as this was my second attempt (the first being a couple of years ago...I can't remember why I stopped reading it). After having not read a piece of fiction for a while, I loved the sense of being swept away in a fictional world, and often thought about the story when I wasn't reading (many 'what would the Edmond do?' moments).

            On the face of it, the storyline is the ultimate revenge story (warning: spoilers). Young and successful man, on the day of his marriage, gets framed by two jealous acquaintances, spend decades in prison, upgrades his life skills, becomes wealthy beyond imagination, takes revenge on those who have done him wrong. There are lots of themes by which the book can be dissected (society and status, fate, revenge, purpose, are the ones that come to mind), but the one that came to regularly throughout the course of the book was one of morality.
