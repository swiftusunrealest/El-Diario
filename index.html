        <p><b>#2 The Count of Monte Cristo</b>
          <p>
          I just finished reading 'The Count of Monte Cristo' a couple of days ago. It took a while (~6 weeks) and I realised that I hadn't read a book of this length since the summer of 2005, when I read 'A Suitable Boy'. It sounds ridiculous, but I felt a sense of accomplishment finishing it, probably as this was my second attempt (the first being a couple of years ago...I can't remember why I stopped reading it). After having not read a piece of fiction for a while, I loved the sense of being swept away in a fictional world, and often thought about the story when I wasn't reading (many 'what would Edmond do?' moments).

            On the face of it, the storyline is the ultimate revenge story (warning: spoilers). Young and successful man, on the day of his marriage, gets framed by two jealous acquaintances, spend decades in prison, upgrades his life skills, becomes wealthy beyond imagination, takes revenge on those who have done him wrong. There are lots of themes by which the book can be dissected (society and status, fate, morality, revenge, are the ones that come to mind), and upon finising the book, I have one question: Is revenge justified?

      Throughout the latter half of the book, Edmond states (to himself and others) that he is on a god-given mission to bring down bring down those who wronged him. The man spent years, accumulating more wealth and meticulously planning how he would bring these people down. And by that, I mean destroy them. Forget about just taking their life away; he wants to put them in a position where he takes away everything they hold dear (whether this is love or money), to the point where his victims determine their demise themselves. He plays the long game, making his way slowly through Parisian society, inventing new aliases (I think he describes using a latex mask?), and never giving away his true identity, even to those he favours. The man is clearly smart and, perhaps, a little psychotic. Scrap that, most definitely psychotic.

      But surely he could've spent those years doing something better? Why waste all that energy plotting and planning, when he could've just enjoyed himself, or helped others? Why be so petty? By the end of the book, I'm not sure to what extent he convinces himself that he's in a better place having carried out his 'duty'. I wonder what would happen if you were to speak to Edmond on his deathbed, and ask him...'Was it all worth it?'
    </p>

      It's tough to say, and I guess you can answer that question if you went through the same pain. From my experience, it would feel like a win at the time and almost essential to get some kind of closure. But on reflection, I can't imagine ever feeling satisfied having just dedicated a portion of my life focussed on making someone else's life miserable. Life is just too short. So, what were his alternatives? He could've killed his enemies quickly and revealed himself (no Harvey Weinstein) to the woman he loved. Or lived in life in anonymous splendour (the best insult against someone is not thinking of them at all?). I feel that Edmond will never truly be at peace. But then this probably would've been the case whether he did or didn't take revenge on his enemies. Who knows.
